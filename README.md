# DestinAI

DestinAI is a project where a backend and frontend work together to provide an AI-powered experience. It can be deployed to any local network.

## Project History

This project started as a 6-man team project for our engineering lesson. What began as a simple assignment ended up becoming something much more significant and evolved into the application you see here.

## AI Disclosure

Generative AI tools were used when needed by me and my team members during the development of this project.

## Setup

This project involves both a backend and a frontend.

### Environment Variables

**Important:** You need to create an `.env` file in the backend directory for this application to function correctly. This file should contain the necessary API keys and configuration secrets. 

**Note:** The `.env` file is not included in this repository for security reasons.
